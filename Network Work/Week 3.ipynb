Hops 6 through 8 show consistent, low latencies, and the traceroute concludes at hop 8 with the IP address 172.217.169.14.\n",

    "Given that YouTube is part of the Google infrastructure, it is not surprising to see a similar routing path to that of google.com. The minor differences in latency, particularly in the earlier hops, could be due to slight variations in network congestion or routing policies specific to YouTube’s traffic."
